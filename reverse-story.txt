Soft, fluffy scavenging.
Aw, this patch of fur is messed up.
I found a nut!
Pull off the acorn cup.
Squeezed, squish, blood and guts.

Swift, gentle, gliding flight.
Danger from above, known to few.
Constant tracking with precision sight.

Still, silent perception.
...
A morsel discovered, quite a nice treat.
