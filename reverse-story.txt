Soft, fluffy scavenging.
Aw, this patch of fur is messed up.
I found a nut!
Pull off the acorn cup.
Squeezed, squish, guts.

Swift, gentle, gliding flight.
Danger from above, known to few.
Constant tracking from aloft a deadly kite.

Still, silent sight.
...
A morsel discovered, quite a nice treat.
