Owls dwell in many a hollow,
Chamber in an ancient life.
They may sleep, look, and swallow
Essence of another's strife.

.. sleep stanza
Eyes still and quiet above
Life running amok in the forest clear.
This owl rests over many of
Whom scurry around with proper fear.

.. wakeup stanza
Bright star loft above horizon.
Eye lids fluttering from a dream.
Stirring, peek around from eyes wizen.
Beak yawns agape with silent scream.

.. catch
Quick spin towards the heard sound.
Prey in sight
Take off, gliding to the ground.
Dinner tonight.
